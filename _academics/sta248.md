## Univariate Data - Data Collection

__Systematic sampling:__ bias if the list has some structure  
__Random Sample:__ Because of randomness -> it is possible to have a bad sample  

__Box and Whisker Plot:__
-   location of 5 # summary
-   symmetry
-   Potential outliers
-   Key quantities

    Maximum  
    3rd quartile  
    medium  
    1st quartile  
    minimum

__Violin Plot:__
Box plot includes the distribution overtop

__empirical cumulative distribution plot (O-give)__
-   relative frequency from Data


## Modality and symmetry
Symmetrical
-   informs us of the distribution of Data
-   unlikely / likely values
-   check assumptions about normality

Left Skewed

IQR -> interquartile range = Q3 - Q1

k% trimmed mean: to remove outliers

Order your Data
1.  counting
2.  finding the location of the k<sup>th</sup> percentile  
    location: k/100 (n-1) + 1  => get weight => weight * left data + (1 - weight) * right data
    the data value x<sub>k</sub> where k% of data are <= x<sub>k</sub>

Median: 50<sup>th</sup> percentile  
First/Third Quartiles: 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile respectively (Q1 and Q3)  

63 / 100 (13 - 1) + 1 = 8.56
0.56 * 11 + 0.44 * 11 = 11

## discriptive Statistics - Measures of Spread

Range: Maximum - minimum  
interquartile Range: 3rd quartile - 1st quartile (Q3 - Q1)  
(sample) Variance: Average squared deviation from the centre. (miu is unknown)  
    ->  Estimate miu with x^-

Population variance:
1.  if we know the probability model
$$V(K) = E[(x-\mu)^2]$$
2.  If looking at entire population,  
Square deviation = $$V(x) =\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{(x_i-\mu)^2}{N}$$

## Measures of Location

Shoe data  
14 11 12 9 7.5 7 10 11 6 10 13 7 11  

1.  Range => Max - Min => 14 - 6 => 8  
2.  IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 11 - 7.5 => 3.5  
3.  Sample Variance => S^2 = ((14 - 8.73)^2 + (11 - 8.73)^2 + ... + (11 - 8.73)^2) / 12  


## Week 3

- A __sample statistic__ (usually denoted a s $$T_n$$ ) is calculated from a sample of size n
- __estimator__ (usually denoted as $$\hat{\theta}$$) for a parameter $$\theta$$ is usually determined or estimated based on a collected sample or data
- with every new sample of size $$n$$, the statistic or estimstor will change in value => $$T_n$$ and $$\hat{\theta}$$ are __random variables__

### Unbiasedness (Def. 7.1.1)

Unbiased => $$ E(\hat{\theta}) = E(\theta) $$

Interpretation: estimator, on avg, will have same value as the unknown parameter

### Consistency
