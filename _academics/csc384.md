## Lecture 2 Uniformed Search

### Depth-first search

Put successor in the front of frontier (open list)

Problem:

- Infinite Depth
- The first solution may not be the best

Time Complexity:

- $$O_m$$ where $$m$$ is the length of the longest path

Space Complexity:

- $$O(bm)$$, linear space
    - Only explore 1 single path
    - OPEN only contains the deepest node on the current path along with the backtrack points

### Depth-limited search

Perform DFS but only to a pre-specified depth `L`

### Iterative Deepening search

Space Complexity

-   $$O(bd)$$, still linear

### Path/Cycle Checking

#### Cycle Checking
-   Ensure that the state c is not equal to the state previously expanded states
-   High Space Complexity


## Heuristic search

Merit of a frontier/OPEN node: different notions of merit

### Cost of solution

If $$h(n_1) < h(n_2)$$ this means that we guess that it is cheaper


### Greedy Best-First Search (Greedy BFS), use only $$h(n)$$

use $$h(n)$$ to rank the nodes on the OPEN
- Always expand node with lowest h-value

However, the method __ignores the cost of getting to $$n$$__, so it can be lead astray exploring nodes that cost a lot but seem to be close to the goal.

=> Incomplete and not optimal
