## Lecture 2 Uniformed Search

### Depth-first search

Put successor in the front of frontier (open list)

Problem:

- Infinite Depth
- The first solution may not be the best

Time Complexity:

- $$O_m$$ where $$m$$ is the length of the longest path

Space Complexity:

- $$O(bm)$$, linear space
    - Only explore 1 single path
    - OPEN only contains the deepest node on the current path along with the backtrack points

### Depth-limited search

Perform DFS but only to a pre-specified depth `L`

### Iterative Deepening search

Space Complexity

-   $$O(bd)$$, still linear

### Path/Cycle Checking

#### Cycle Checking
-   Ensure that the state c is not equal to the state previously expanded states
-   High Space Complexity


## Heuristic search

Merit of a frontier/OPEN node: different notions of merit

### Cost of solution

If $$h(n_1) < h(n_2)$$ this means that we guess that it is cheaper


### Greedy Best-First Search (Greedy BFS), use only $$h(n)$$

use $$h(n)$$ to rank the nodes on the OPEN
- Always expand node with lowest h-value

However, the method __ignores the cost of getting to $$n$$__, so it can be lead astray exploring nodes that cost a lot but seem to be close to the goal.

=> Incomplete and not optimal


### Optimality

1. The $$f$$-values of nodes along a path must be non-decreasing  
=> $$f(n_i) \leq f(n_{i+1})$$
2. if $$n_2$$ is expanded after $$n_q$$, then $$f(n_1) \leq f(n_2)$$ (the $$f$$-value increases monotonically)
3. When $$n$$ is expanded every path with lower $$f$$-value has already been expanded.
4. When a monotone heuristic, the first time $$A*$$ expands a state, it has found the minimum cost to that state

a. By 1. $$f(n_{i+1}) \leq f(n_k)$$ since they lie along the same path  
b. since $$f(n_k) < f(n)$$ (given) so we have $$(f_{n})

#### Space problem with $$A*$$

$$A*$$ has the same potential space problems as BFS or UCS

#### $$IDA*$$ - Iterative Deepening A*

## Constructing Heuristics

### Domain Knowledge
-   How many misplaced tiles

### Manhattan Distance
-   Distance misplaced tiles to the goal
-   Take the sum of the distance that each tile is from its goal position

| 8 | 2 |   |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 6 | 7 | 1 |

4 + 1 + 3 = 8
