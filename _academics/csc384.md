## Lecture 2 Uniformed Search

### Depth-first search

Put successor in the front of frontier (open list)

Problem:

- Infinite Depth
- The first solution may not be the best

Time Complexity:

- O(b<sup>m</sup>) where `m` is the length of the longest path

Space Complexity:

- O(bm), linear space
    - Only explore 1 single path
    - OPEN only contains the deepest node on the current path along with the backtrack points

### Depth-limited search

Perform DFS but only to a pre-specified depth `L`

### Iterative Deepening search

Space Complexity

-   O(bd), still linear

### Path/Cycle Checking

#### Cycle Checking
-   Ensure that the state c is not equal to the state previously expanded states
-   High Space Complexity
