## Lecture 2

### Sessions
-   Interactive: Short messages, small delay, high reliability
-   File Transfer: Long messages, moderate delay, high reliability
-   Digitized Voice: Short messages, fixed small delay, moderate reliability
-   Web traffic: Long messages, small delay, high reliability
-   Video: Long messages, fixed small delay. Requires broadcast and multicast capabilities

### Sending message over network
-   Routing
-   Addressing
-   Reliable Data Transfer
-   Congesting Control

In this course, we will discuss 5 internet layers

peer process: process running on each machine  
protocol  
service

Network Layer - must "speak" same language  

__Transmission Delay:__ depends on the packet length, sending data, $$\frac{l}{C}$$, where $$C$$ is the transmission speed and $$l$$ lis length of packet.
__Propagation Delay:__ Transmission (data cannot go faster than light speed)
__Processing Delay:__ receive (need to receive and do some decoding/processing/routing)  
__Queuing Delay:__ (Traffic crossing, data will have to wait for routing)

router can process data only when the whole packet is received

## Lecture 3

### Approach

1. Reliable data Transfer
2. Performance Analysis / QoS Evaluation
3. Modeling and Analysis of Protocols
4. Implementation issues

### ARQ: Automatic Repeat Request

-   Can be used in every layer
-   TCP uses ARQ

Ideally, every packet is received without errors  
In reality, Bad things can happen:

-   bits get flipped/corrupted
-   packet gets lost
-   error has delay

### ARQ: Retransmission Strategies

#### Objective:

Design a protocol such that each packet is delivered once, and only once, without errors.

#### Assumptions (data link layer):
-   All packets with errors are detected
-   Delay can be arbitrary Long
-   Some packet maybe lost
-   Packets that arrive are in the same order


#### Stop-and-Wait ARQ using Modulus 2
SN, RN

#### Go-Back n ARQ

have a window of n packets
