## Intro
We would like to build a mobile app to help people find food they like more easily. There are two roles in our application: recommender, recommandee and maybe a third role for event organizers/restaurant owners/shop owners to post the highlights for their organization on the app. A user can be both a recommender and a recommendee. Recommenders can share some sort of impressive food they've tried with photo and reviews. Recommendees will get a feed of post, presenting food recommended by other users. The recommendation varies according to userâ€™s habits.

This is a [CSC301](https://csc301-winter-2017.github.io) Group Project, but our goal is to bring it live on App Store.

## Technology we are using
- Front-end:  [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- Backend:  Node.js and express
- Database:  mongoDB

## Problems noticed during development
1. Since we are all year 3 students, everyone has a lot of course work other than this one. Team kick start was very difficult at the beginning.
